# Overview:
This project focuses on predicting music genres using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and logistic regression for classification.

# Project Description:
The project involves developing a machine learning model to accurately classify music styles based on audio data. The primary techniques used are PCA for dimensionality reduction and logistic regression for building the classification model.

# Key Components:

# Data: ### Raw data files should be placed in the 'data/raw/' directory.
Notebooks: Three notebooks guide the project - 'data_exploration.ipynb' for dataset exploration, 'feature_engineering.ipynb' for extracting features, and 'model_training.ipynb' for implementing PCA and training the logistic regression model.
Source Code: Python scripts in the 'src' directory handle data preprocessing ('preprocessing.py'), dimensionality reduction ('dimensionality_reduction.py'), and model training ('model.py').
Installation: Clone the repository and install dependencies listed in 'requirements.txt'.
Usage:
Follow the notebooks sequentially for a step-by-step project walkthrough. The 'src' directory provides reusable source code for specific tasks.
